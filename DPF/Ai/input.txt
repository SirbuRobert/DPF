The Sumerians are a collection of city-states in southern Mesopotamia, including Ur, Bad-tibira, and Eridu, which is believed to be the oldest city in the region. In about 5000 BCE, nomads living in the region began to settle in the fertile land near the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. They formed small villages which eventually developed into the civilization known as Sumer.
