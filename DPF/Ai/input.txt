The discovery of the double helix structure of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) stands as a monumental achievement in 20th-century science. Before this breakthrough, specifically throughout the 1930s, the prevailing scientific consensus incorrectly held that proteins, not nucleic acids, were the carriers of genetic information due to their apparent complexity. This fundamental view began to shift dramatically in 1944 when groundbreaking work at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research unequivocally demonstrated DNA's role as the genuine genetic material responsible for transforming bacterial traits.

The race to determine the definitive three-dimensional structure culminated in 1953. At the University of Cambridge, *James Watson* and *Francis Crick* famously deduced the double helix model. Crucially, their work was heavily dependent on indirect access to vital X-ray diffraction images. The most famous of these, known as "Photograph 51," was produced in *May 1952* by *Rosalind Franklin* while working with *Maurice Wilkins* at King's College London. This image provided the clear, crucial evidence confirming the helical nature of the molecule.

Watson, Crick, and Wilkins were recognized for their seminal contribution in *1962, receiving the **Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine*. Tragically, Rosalind Franklin, whose data was instrumental, had passed away from cancer in 1958 and was thus ineligible for the honor, as Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously. The determination of the DNA structure immediately unlocked the secrets of genetic replication and laid the essential groundwork for modern fields like genomics, molecular biology, and biotechnology.
